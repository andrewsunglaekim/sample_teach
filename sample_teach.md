<h2>Objectives</h2>
#####

- recap loops in ruby
- each method on Arrays
- enumerators
- iteratee

<h2>Assessment</h2>

- students will be asked to construct an array and execute an each method on it
- students will break into groups and look through ruby:enumerable documentation and pick one to present to the rest of class.

<h2>Opening Framing</h2>

- Speak to the importance of loops in programming in general
	- why do we use loops?
- What makes enumerators more effective?

<h2>I do</h2>

- Recap loops and how to execute a loop in ruby
	- as we write out the ruby loop, ask questions along the way
	- why do we need to an instantiate variable i and increment it
- explain why enumerators make life easier

<h2>We do</h2>

- Write out an each method with class
- give class rest of assignment, walk around and see if students need help working through classwork
- give feedback for anyone struggling and help them work through the problem without explicitly giving answers

<h2>You do</h2>

- Encourage students to dive further into ruby documentation on the enumerable module.
- issue homework on lesson
- be available for questions

<h2>Closing Framing</h2>
- ask for any questions students might have
- encourage students to go back and refactor old loops they have written and use enumerators instead
